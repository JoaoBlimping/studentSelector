# studentSelector
Lets you put students into groups and also randomly select them and stuff

# TODO
 - **Do this next** - make some kind of parser so that I can make nice page descriptions
   that are put onto the screen with javascript. javascript has a built in one, nice!
 - let you give the groups names
 - let you go back to the select group screen when you so desire
 - make the ui less stupid
